# Large Language Models ‚Äì Text Analysis and Generation in the Era of Generative AI

This repository contains the research summary and academic report of a master's-level paper focused on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and their application across key domains in the DACH region, with a focus on Switzerland.

## Project Context

This work was created as part of an applied research module (AFE1) at the **Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU)** and the **Fernfachhochschule Schweiz (FFHS)** in spring 2024.

The paper provides both technical and application-oriented insights into LLMs, laying the groundwork for future prototyping in education and Swiss-specific domains.
